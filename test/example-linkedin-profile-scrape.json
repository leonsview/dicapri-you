Amit exhibited great motivation on every project we worked together. When he put his mind to something he went above and beyond to make sure that it got executed to a high quality standard and on time. His pro-activeness probably played a huge part in this. Additionally, his ability to be a team player and bring out the best of each team member is exceptional. Equally, important however, are his capabilities. He was creative / innovative for each of the assignments we worked on and did well in focusing on the analytics side (not just looking at the symptoms but the cause. Being in the technology industry myself (Facebook) I can also vouch for his understanding of the tech industry. \r\n\r\nI fully respect Amit and whole-heartedly endorse him for whatever he puts his mind to.",
